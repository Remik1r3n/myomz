# MyOMZ!
MyOMZ is a simple installer for oh-my-zsh (and its common-used plugins), 
with cross-user(/usr/share) installation and multiple mirrors selection, designed mainly for mainland Chinese users.

Most common Linux distros are supported. 

# How to use
Download myomz.sh in your way, then execute it as root.

For example, you can directly run this command: `sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.fgit.ml/Lapis-Apple/myomz/master/myomz.sh)"`

Or this command, which will download directly from GitHub. `sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/Lapis-Apple/myomz/raw/main/myomz.sh)"`

macOS is currently, sadly, **NOT** supported.
