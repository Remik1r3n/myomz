# MyOMZ!
MyOMZ is a simple installer for oh-my-zsh (and its common-used plugins), 
with cross-user(/usr/share) installation and multiple mirrors selection, designed mainly for mainland Chinese users.

Most common Linux distros are supported. macOS may be supported, any bugs please report.

# How to use
Download myomz.sh in your way, then execute it as root.

A quick way is to run this command: `sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/Remik1r3n/myomz/raw/main/myomz.sh)"`
